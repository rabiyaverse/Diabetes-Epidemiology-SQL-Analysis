# Diabetes-Epidemiology-SQL-Analysis
Practical epidemiology project using SQL on a Kaggle diabetes dataset to analyse how metabolic risk factors relate to diabetes outcomes, with exposure categorisation, stratified analyses, and crude association measures.

## Background
This project uses SQL to conduct descriptive and analytic epidemiological analyses
of diabetes risk factors in a cross-sectional dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset includes 768 individuals and variables such as:
- Age
- BMI
- Glucose
- Insulin
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Pregnancies
- Diabetes outcome (0 = no, 1 = yes)

## Outcome distribution
Among 768 participants:
- 268 (34.9%) had diabetes
- 500 (65.1%) did not have diabetes

## Methods
Descriptive and analytic epidemiology using SQL, including:
- Frequency distributions
- Exposure categorisation
- Risk factor comparisons
