# Diabetes-Epidemiology-SQL-Analysis
Practical epidemiology project using SQL on a Kaggle diabetes dataset to analyse how metabolic risk factors relate to diabetes outcomes, with exposure categorisation, stratified analyses, and crude association measures.

## Background
This project uses SQL to conduct descriptive and analytic epidemiological analyses
of diabetes risk factors in a cross-sectional dataset.

##📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes 768 individuals and variables such as:
- Age
- BMI
- Glucose
- Insulin
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Pregnancies
- Diabetes outcome (0 = no, 1 = yes)

##📈 Outcome distribution
Among 768 participants:
- 268 (34.9%) had diabetes
- 500 (65.1%) did not have diabetes

##🧪 Methods
Epidemiological analyses conducted using SQL include:
- Descriptive statistics
- Exposure categorisation (e.g. BMI groups)
- Outcome comparisons (diabetes vs no diabetes)
- Preliminary risk factor exploration

##🔍 Key Skills Demonstrated
- SQL for health data analysis  
- Descriptive and analytic epidemiology  
- Chronic disease risk factor assessment  
- Clear communication of public health findings
