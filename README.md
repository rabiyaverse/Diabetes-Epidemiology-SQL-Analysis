# Diabetes-Epidemiology-SQL-Analysis
Practical epidemiology project using SQL on a Kaggle diabetes dataset to analyse how metabolic risk factors relate to diabetes outcomes, with exposure categorisation, stratified analyses, and crude association measures.

## Background
This project uses SQL to conduct descriptive and analytic epidemiological analyses
of diabetes risk factors in a cross-sectional dataset.

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset includes 768 individuals and variables such as:
- Age
- BMI
- Glucose
- Insulin
- Blood pressure
- Skin thickness
- Pregnancies
- Diabetes outcome (0 = no, 1 = yes)

## 📈 Outcome distribution
Among 768 participants:
- 268 (34.9%) had diabetes
- 500 (65.1%) did not have diabetes

## ❤️ BMI by Diabetes Outcome

The mean body mass index (BMI) differed between participants with and without diabetes as shown in Table 1. 

| Outcome | n_participants | Mean BMI |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| 0 (No diabetes) | 500 | 30.30 |
| 1 (Diabetes) | 268 | 35.14 |

Table 1. BMI by Diabetes Outcome 

This finding suggests a higher average BMI among individuals with diabetes in this dataset, consistent with established evidence linking obesity to increased risk of type 2 diabetes.


## 🧪 Methods
Epidemiological analyses conducted using SQL include:
- Descriptive statistics
- Exposure categorisation (e.g. BMI groups)
- Outcome comparisons (diabetes vs no diabetes)
- Preliminary risk factor exploration

## 🔍 Key Skills Demonstrated
- SQL for health data analysis  
- Descriptive and analytic epidemiology  
- Chronic disease risk factor assessment  
- Clear communication of public health findings
